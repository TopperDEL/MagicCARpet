# MagicCARpet

MagicCARpet is an innovative app that brings the imagination of children to life by blending the physical and digital worlds. Utilizing the latest in AR/VR technology, users can place nodes that represent streets in a virtual environment. Between these nodes, toy cars in 3D will move around, creating a dynamic and interactive cityscape.

## Features

- **AR/VR Capabilities**: MagicCARpet leverages augmented and virtual reality to create a seamless and immersive experience. Users can interact with the app in a fully three-dimensional space, placing nodes that become the streets of a bustling city.

- **User Interaction**: The app is designed with simplicity and intuitiveness in mind. Users can easily place nodes within the AR/VR environment to design their city. Toy cars will then navigate the streets, bringing the city to life.

- **Passthrough Technology**: By incorporating passthrough technology, MagicCARpet allows users to see their real-world environment while interacting with the virtual city. This creates a magical experience where the digital and physical worlds collide, making it seem as if the city carpet for kids starts to "live".

MagicCARpet is more than just an app; it's a gateway to creativity and imagination, where children can design, build, and interact with their own virtual cities.
